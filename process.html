    <h3>Debate and discussion</h3>
    <p>
      Nebraska's Legislature held committee hearings and floor debate on these proposals, with public testimony and extended debate.
      LB626 was debated early in the 2023 session and later, lawmakers debated combining abortion restrictions into LB574.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Committee hearings included public testimony.</li>
      <li>Floor debate included motions, amendments, and attempts to end debate (cloture).</li>
      <li>Some provisions from LB626 were amended into LB574 later in the session.</li>
    </ul>
