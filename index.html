    <h3>What is this about?</h3>
    <p>
      After the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Nebraska lawmakers debated new abortion restrictions.
      This project focuses on how Nebraska legislators handled a "heartbeat" bill (LB626) and how its abortion restrictions later
      appeared in another bill (LB574).

    <h3>Bill explained on the title page</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>LB626</strong>, introduced January 17, 2023, was titled "Adopt the Nebraska Heartbeat Act."
      It proposed restricting abortions once "cardiac activity" could be detected, commonly described as around six weeks of pregnancy.
      LB626 did not become law on its own, later portions were amended into <strong>LB574</strong>.

    <h3>Purpose and what it changed or proposed</h3>
    <p>
      The significance of these bills was that they would change Nebraska's abortion policy after Roe v. Wade.
      LB626 proposed an earlier restriction (heartbeat standard).
      LB574 ultimately became law, including an abortion restriction based on weeks of pregnancy, plus other health related provisions.
